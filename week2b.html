    <h1> String Theory </h1>
    <p> "String Theory brings together an exciting collaboration of song craftsmanship and symphonic majesty, framing the established trio’s music through a special collaboration with Academy award winning arranger David Campbell, spawning both a world tour featuring the band playing live with Symphony Orchestras, and a studio album.

HANSON’s most ambitious musical project to date features songs spanning the band’s career, including some of their best known material (“MmmBop”, “Where’s The Love”, “This Time Around” and more) alongside brand new or never-released-to-the-public songs (“Reaching For The Sky”, “Battle Cry”, “Breaktown”, “No Rest For The Weary” and more) which tell a story of aspiration, despair, fortitude and ultimately a return to optimism.

Fans can discover String Theory both as an album and as a concert, with North American dates starting Summer 2018 and running through Summer 2019, and music released in Fall 2018." </p>
